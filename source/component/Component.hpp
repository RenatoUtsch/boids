/**
 * GameObjects are buckets of data. The data that the GameObjects hold are
 * Components. The Components are data that is managed by the correspondent
 * System classes.
 *
 * When inheriting this class to create your own components, you MUST do two
 * things to make the component work with the GameObject-Component system of
 * this Engine.
 *
 * First, when creating your inherited class, the first line of the class
 * MUST be the following macro: COMPONENT_CLASS(ComponentName).
 * This will create the static ComponentName::Id variable and implement the
 * ComponentName::id() function that is declared in the Component class, both
 * with ComponentNameId as its value.
 *
 * Second, you need to register your component type.
 * Open the file "componentRegistration.hpp.inc" (relative to this directory)
 * and, after the last REGISTER_COMPONENT(ComponentName) line, add your own,
 * with the name of the new component as parameter. This will create an unique
 * ComponentNameId value of the ComponentId enum that will represent your
 * component in the GameObject-Component system.
 *
 * For example, if your component is called MyShinyComponent, in the definition
 * of your class, you MUST add COMPONENT_CLASS(MyShinyComponent) (note the
 * absence of semicolons) as the first line of the class:
 *
 * class MyShinyComponent : public Component {
 *     COMPONENT_CLASS(MyShinyComponent)
 *
 *     // Your shiny class contents go here...
 *     // ...
 * };
 *
 * After that, you MUST add in the file "componentRegistration.hpp.inc" the line
 * REGISTER_COMPONENT(MyShinyComponent) (note, again, the absence of semicolon)
 * after the last REGISTER_COMPONENT line.
 *
 * Doing those two simple things, your component will be integrated with the
 * GameObject-Component system.
